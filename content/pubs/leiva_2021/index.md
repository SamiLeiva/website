excerpt: Studies of patients with right hemisphere damage (RHD) have consistently found impairments to their ability to recognize emotions from facial expressions and prosodic cues. However, there is no consensus as to whether these deficits extend to other types of emotional expression such as body movements. The aim of this study was to compare the performances of RHD patients and a healthy control group at recognizing basic and complex emotions from dynamic facial and bodily expressions.

## Abstract

*Objective:* Studies of patients with right hemisphere damage (RHD) have consistently found impairments to their ability to recognize emotions from facial expressions and prosodic cues. However, there is no consensus as to whether these deficits extend to other types of emotional expression such as body movements. The objective of this study was to compare the performances of RHD patients and a healthy control group at recognizing basic and complex emotions from dynamic facial and bodily expressions. *Methods:* We evaluated 17 adult RHD patients whose lesions had occurred at least six months previously, and 17 healthy control subjects. Four emotional tests were given using dynamic facial and bodily expression stimuli for basic and complex emotions and two nonemotional tests for facial perception and identification of nonemotional bodily movements. *Results:* The results showed that RHD patients performed worse than the control group at all emotion recognition tests for both facial and bodily expressions. Positive correlations were observed between the four emotional tests for the whole sample and for the RHD group. Finally, there were no significant differences between the RHD patients and the control group in the two nonemotional tests. *Conclusions:* The results of the study suggest that impairments to emotion recognition in RHD patients are not limited to facial expressions but also include bodily expressions of different types of emotions. These findings underscore the importance of extending characterizations of patients’ emotion recognition skills beyond facial expressions.
